    We believe in the eternal, omnipotent, omnipresent, and immutable triune God, maker of heaven and earth, and all that in then is: and in the unity of the Godhead there are three persons, equal in every divine perfection and attribute, executing distinct, but harmonious offices, in the great work of redemption.
